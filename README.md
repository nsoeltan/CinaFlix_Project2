CinaFlix is a movie watch list application that allows a user to:

1. Search for a movie by leveraging the Open Movie Database (OMDB) API and storing the searched movie in the Movies Table in the mySQL database
2. Read through movie specific information retrieved from OMDB's API such as the: Movie Name, Movie POster, Genre, Year, Run Time, IMDB Rating, Actors and Plot
3. Watch the trailer of the searched movie on YouTube
4. Add the searched movie to the Watch List section in the UI
5. Click on the displayed media source links in the app to watch the movie on either Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO or Hulu
6. Remove the movie from the Watch list section in the UI
7. Delete the movie, and thereby thus deleting all associated information from the my SQL database once the user clicks on the "Delete" button
